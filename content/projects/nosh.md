**Nosh** is a specification and toolset for creating "machine-readable companion files" for web content. Think of it as **RSS for the agentic web**.

Instead of agents scraping HTML and guessing at structure, Nosh provides a clean, structured data feed (JSON/TOML) that describes the content, intent, and available actions of a page.

### The Stack
- **Language:** Rust
- **Format:** JSON / TOML specs
- **Goal:** Reduce hallucination and parsing errors for autonomous agents.
