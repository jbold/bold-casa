**Exoclaw** is an experimental runtime for AI agents, focusing on security and isolation.

By leveraging **WebAssembly (WASM)**, Exoclaw provides a sandboxed environment where agent capabilities (tools) can be executed safely, without giving the model unfettered access to the host system.

### The Stack
- **Runtime:** WASM (Wasmtime)
- **Language:** Rust
- **Security:** Capability-based security model (Object Capabilities)
