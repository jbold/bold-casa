### 🏗️ The Focus
I am currently rebuilding my systems—digital and physical.

- **OpenClaw (Kit):** Developing a self-hosted AI assistant that has real agency on my Linux machine. It's not just a chat bot; it's a second brain that executes code and manages my infrastructure.
- **Ice Storm Ops:** Capitalizing on the recent Nashville storms. Running a tree service crew to clear debris. Chainsaws, trucks, and logistics.
- **Legal Defense:** Pro se litigation against HCA. Writing filings, organizing discovery, and fighting for ADA rights.

### 📚 Reading / Learning

- **Rust:** Deepening my understanding of async runtimes and WASM security (Exoclaw).
- **LLM Ops:** Fine-tuning the context window management for long-running agent sessions.

### 🛠️ The Workshop status

- **Mood:** Determined.
- **Physical:** Recovering runner.
- **Digital:** Migrating everything to immutable OS (Silverblue).
