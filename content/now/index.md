### 🏗️ The Focus

- **Agent Memory Infrastructure:** Built a local GPU-accelerated memory system for my AI agent using SurrealDB (document + graph + vector) and Qwen3-Embedding-4B running on an RTX 5070 Ti. Vector search, concept graphs, temporal edges — all localhost, all mine. [Wrote it up here.](/blog/local-gpu-memory-for-ai-agents/) Published the [sanitized prototype on GitHub.](https://github.com/jbold/surrealdb-agent-memory)
- **Nosh:** Created an open spec for embedding structured, machine-readable content in your page's `<head>` so AI agents get typed knowledge instead of parsing HTML. 4.1x fewer tokens, same knowledge. [Blog post.](/blog/nosh-rss-for-the-agentic-web/) [Spec on GitHub.](https://github.com/jbold/nosh)
- **bold.casa Redesign:** Rebuilt the blog's visual identity — monospace typography, navy blueprint aesthetic, surgical CSS overrides on the tabi theme. Mobile-tested.
- **Clawguard:** Agent ops guardrail layer — budget enforcement, watchdog, shield, control plane. Primary product wedge. Architecture phase.
- **Legal Defense:** Pro se EEOC/ADA litigation against HCA. Researching domain-specific legal embedding models (voyage-law-2, LEGAL-BERT) for evidence analysis and potential pro se legal AI product.

### 📚 Reading / Learning

- **Agent memory architectures:** Surveyed MemGPT/Letta OS, OpenAI's approach, Claude's memory, AI Toolkits patterns. Landed on SurrealDB multi-model as the foundation.
- **Legal AI:** voyage-law-2 tops MTEB legal benchmarks. Open-source alternatives exist. Exploring whether pro se legal AI could be the shippable product.
- **GEO (Generative Engine Optimization):** How to make content AI-agent-friendly. Nosh is my answer.

### 🛠️ The Workshop

- **Machine:** ROG Strix G16 — Ryzen 9 8940HX, 64GB DDR5, RTX 5070 Ti 12GB, Fedora Silverblue
- **Stack:** OpenClaw + Kit (Claude Opus 4.6), SurrealDB, Qwen3-Embedding-4B, Zola, Obsidian
- **Mood:** Building.
- **Upcoming:** ClawCon Nashville — Feb 17, co-hosting with Dieter Scholtyssek. Duluth building trip. Taxes.
