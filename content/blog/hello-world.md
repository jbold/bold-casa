I grew up in my father's piano workshop. He's a true craftsman — an artist who taught me everything about cars, guns, music, and building things. He was my first mentor and teacher.

My favorite childhood book was *Samuel Morse: Inquisitive Boy* — an antique my dad bought me. My brother Paul and I practiced sending morse code on walkie talkies. I entered a light-sensor motor contraption in the 4th grade science fair. It got 4th place, behind the volcano. I've been taking things apart ever since.

Since then I've written code, built products, ran a 15-acre farm, lived in four countries, and learned four languages. The thread connecting all of it: **I need to understand how things work, then make them better.**

This site is my workshop. The digital version of that room full of piano guts and tools on pegboard. I'll be writing about:

- **AI tooling and infrastructure** — self-hosted, sovereign, no big-tech dependency
- **Building in public** — real build logs, not polished marketing
- **The debugging sagas** — because the interesting part is always the part that broke
- **Making things** — code, hardware, systems, dirt

First real post coming soon: a deep dive into unlocking 1 million token context in Claude Opus 4.6 through OpenClaw — a debugging journey through 9 walls of configuration hell.

Pull up a chair. The workshop is open.
