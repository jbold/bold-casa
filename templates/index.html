<section class="about">
    <p>I'm a builder. Started with Radio Shack breadboard kits and a book about Samuel Morse. Grew up in my father's piano workshop — where I learned that understanding <em>how</em> something works is the first step to making it better.</p>

    <p>Since then I've built adtech systems, turned a 15-acre hobby farm profitable, shipped products from zero, and lived and worked across four countries. My strengths: spotting patterns early, synthesizing cross-domain ideas, and building operational systems that actually work.</p>

    <p>Right now I'm building in the open — AI tooling, self-hosted infrastructure, and whatever else needs taking apart. This is my workshop. Pull up a chair.</p>
